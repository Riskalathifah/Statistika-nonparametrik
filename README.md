# Analysis of Life Expectancy at Birth Based on Provinces in Indonesia (2020-2023)

Welcome to the repository for the **Final Project of Non-Parametric Statistics**, titled: **Analysis of Life Expectancy at Birth Based on Provinces in Indonesia (2020-2023)**. This project explores key trends and statistical insights regarding life expectancy (LEB) in Indonesia, leveraging non-parametric statistical methods to provide a deeper understanding of public health indicators.

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**
Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB) serves as a critical indicator of Human Development Index (HDI) and plays a significant role in assessing progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This analysis examines LEB across Indonesian provinces from 2020 to 2023, using non-parametric statistical methods to:
- Identify trends and patterns over time.
- Detect significant differences between provinces and years.
- Provide policy recommendations for improving public health.

---

## üîç **Key Objectives**
1. Analyze LEB trends across provinces from 2020 to 2023.
2. Evaluate whether differences in LEB across years are statistically significant.
3. Correlate LEB with external variables and provide actionable insights.

---

## üìä **Statistical Methods**
This project uses the following non-parametric statistical tests:
1. **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: To check for differences in LEB distributions across groups.
2. **Jonckheere-Terpstra Test**: To identify trends in ordered groups.
3. **Friedman Test**: To assess repeated measures data.
4. **Page Test**: To evaluate ordered alternatives in repeated measures.
5. **Spearman‚Äôs Correlation**: To determine relationships between variables.
6. **Multiple Comparison Test**: To pinpoint significant differences between provinces.

## üìù **Findings**
1. **LEB Trends**: Positive trends observed in LEB values from 2020 to 2023.
2. **Significant Differences**: Non-parametric tests revealed significant differences between years and provinces.
3. **Policy Recommendations**: Suggestions include targeted health interventions to improve equality in LEB across provinces.

## üí° **Future Work**
- Include additional demographic and economic variables to enhance the analysis.
- Explore machine learning methods for predictive modeling.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration of LEB data.
